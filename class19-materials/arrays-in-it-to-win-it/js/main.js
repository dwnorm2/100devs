//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let threeMovies = ["toy story", "toyr story 2", "toy story 3"];
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let firstMovie = threeMovies[0];
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let arrayLength = threeMovies.length;
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lastArrayElement = threeMovies[arrayLength - 1];

// console.log(lastArrayElement);
